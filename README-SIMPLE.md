# Amazon Books - Simple Deployment

## 🎯 **The Working Way (No Bullshit)**

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend**
```bash
./deploy-simple.sh
```
That's it. Your API is live.

### **Step 2: Deploy Frontend (Optional)**
If you want the UI, use Vercel:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Deploy
4. Set environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = your Railway URL

## 🚀 **Alternative: Even Simpler**

### **Railway Dashboard (No CLI)**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select this repo
4. Wait 2 minutes
5. Done

### **Render (Also Simple)**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click "New" → "Web Service"
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Select "Python"
5. Deploy

## 📝 **What Actually Works**

- ✅ **Railway** - Just works
- ✅ **Render** - Just works  
- ✅ **Vercel** - For frontend
- ❌ **Heroku** - Overcomplicated
- ❌ **Docker** - Overkill for this

## 🎉 **You're Done**

Your API will be at: `https://your-app.railway.app`

Test it: `curl https://your-app.railway.app/`

That's it. No Docker. No complex configs. No bullshit.
